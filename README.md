# challenge
uncover the VM bytecode (devirtualizeMe, I guess) + capture the flag

# Notes

- Your input "key" to the binary as an argument, must be 16 characters in length (a-z, A-Z ... no numbers or special symbols included here)
- Recover the VM bytecode, and the flag, and DM both of those to me on discord `@terraphax` ...
- For the VM bytecode, send a screenshot or inline text of your disassembled basic blocks of the custom instruction set... for the flag, send the string.

# Hint

As a hint, the function that has parts of it virtualized is at 0x0000000140001770 during runtime.
